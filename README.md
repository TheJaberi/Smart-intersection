Authors: Adnan Jaberi, Hashem Alzaki, Natheer Radhi

A smart road simulation using the Rust programming language and the SDL2 library. 
The project aims to design a new traffic strategy algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) 
to pass an intersection without collisions and with minimal congestion.

The project was implemented as a part of the Reboot01 coding institute curriculum (01Edu platform).
